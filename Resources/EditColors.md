## Editing ESP/Menu Colors (ADVANCED) :
### DO NOT MESSAGE ME ABOUT EDITING COLORS. It's not my problem you can't read instructions.
  1. Open your Script.lua file in Notepad or preferrably [ZeroBrane](https://studio.zerobrane.com/download?not-this-time) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
  2. Press CTRL+F and search for "**-- COPY FROM HERE**" without the ""
  3. You should see something like this :  
    ![alt text](https://github.com/Izoee/NexnetPlus/blob/main/Resources/colorsCode.png?raw=true)
  4. You can change any of the number values to RGBA color codes for custom colors. (Generate RGBA color codes [here](https://rgbacolorpicker.com/))
  5. For example, if you want to change the color of the world events to red,  
    ![alt text](https://github.com/Izoee/NexnetPlus/blob/main/Resources/colorsCode2.png?raw=true)  
    you would change the **255, 255, 255, 255** to **255, 0, 0, 255**
  6. Save the Script.lua file

#### WARNING : You will have to re-update your custom colors when I add features or update Nexnet+.
#### If you crash, re-download Nexnet+ and try again... or don't, I'm not your dad.
