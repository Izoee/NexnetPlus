## Editing ESP/Menu Colors (ADVANCED) :
### DO NOT MESSAGE ME ABOUT EDITING COLORS. It's not my problem you can't read instructions.
#### First Time
  1. Open your Script.lua file in Notepad
  2. Press CTRL+F and search for "-- COPY FROM HERE" without the ""
  3. You should see something like this :
    ![alt text](https://github.com/Izoee/NexnetPlus/blob/main/colorsCode.png?raw=true)
  4. You can change any of the integer values to RGBA color codes for custom colors
  5. For example, if we want to change the color of the world events to red,
    ![alt text](https://github.com/Izoee/NexnetPlus/blob/main/colorsCode2.png?raw=true)  
    we would change the 255, 255, 255, 255 to 255, 0, 0, 255
  6. Save the Script.lua file
  7. Copy the code you changed that is show in the first image into a new text file and save it as colors.txt
  8. Whenever you update Nexnet+, copy the code from colors.txt, and replace the color code in the Script.lua and save.

#### If you crash, re-download Nexnet+ and try again... or don't, I'm not your dad.
